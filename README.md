# eat-your-fruits
In the game eat your fruits, the user needs to eat healthy food(apples and bananas) as much as possible and avoid junk food(cheesy puffs and doughnuts) at every cost. If they end up eating more junk food than healthy food, they lose the game. The users need to use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys on their keyboard to help the character move around and get a bite of (hopefully, healthy) food items.
